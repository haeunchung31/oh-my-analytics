# Storytelling & Reporting

**Owner**: Orchestrator
**Purpose**: Construct a compelling narrative and deliver the final output.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Critical Language Rule**: All reasoning, prompting, and intermediate artifacts (`.md` files) are in **English**. The **FINAL REPORT** delivered to stakeholders must be in **KOREAN (한국어)**.

## 1. Report Structure
1. **Executive Summary** (The "BLUF" - Bottom Line Up Front)
   - The Question.
   - The Answer (Key Insight).
   - The Recommendation.
2. **Context & Methodology**
   - Data sources, date ranges, filters applied.
   - Assumptions made.
3. **Detailed Findings**
   - Supporting charts (See `skills/visualization.md` for standards).
   - Logical flow (A led to B).
4. **Appendices**
   - Query logic, detailed tables.

## 2. Storytelling Principles
- **Headline Driven**: Every section should have a takeaway message.
- **So What?**: Always explain the business implication, not just the number.
- **Visuals First**: The narrative should support the visuals, which should be self-explanatory (see `skills/visualization.md`).
