# Reporting Skills

> [!CAUTION]
> **Critical Language Rule**: All reasoning, prompting, and intermediate artifacts (`.md` files) are in **English**. The **FINAL REPORT** delivered to stakeholders must be in **KOREAN (한국어)**.

**Goal**: Communicate insights clearly to stakeholders.

## Report Structure
1. **Executive Summary** (The "BLUF" - Bottom Line Up Front)
   - The Question.
   - The Answer (Key Insight).
   - The Recommendation.
2. **Context & Methodology**
   - Data sources, date ranges, filters applied.
   - Assumptions made.
3. **Detailed Findings**
   - Supporting charts and evidence.
   - logical flow (A led to B).
4. **Appendices**
   - Query logic, detailed tables.

## Storytelling Tips
- **Headlines**: Use active titles for charts (e.g., "Revenue Grew 20% in Q4" instead of "Revenue by Quarter").
- **Annotations**: Point out peaks, valleys, and events on charts.
- **Simplicity**: One idea per slide/section.
